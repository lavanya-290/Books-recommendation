# Books-recommendation
the dataset is from'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset'

this is a recommendation system that creates recommendation based on ratings of books.
I have used a sorted and a filtered(cut down) list of 200 books which have atleast 50 ratings given by a filtered set of 200 users
who give ratings frequently.
Using this list i have created a model based on the K nearest neighbors algorithm,to get recommendations.
It recommends books that have been given similar ratings.
